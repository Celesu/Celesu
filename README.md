- 👋 Hi, I’m @Celesu
- 👀 I’m interested in programming (automating something to makes my life easier) 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning things about data
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on solving some problems on hacker rank maybe(?) or full time/internship on data related job (I prefer data engineer, since I'm more into creating code) 
- 📫 You can reach me by email rzanjab@gmail.com or visit me on my hackerrank account on https://www.hackerrank.com/rzanjab or my codeabbey account on https://www.codeabbey.com/index/user_profile/celesu

🍀🍀 Thanks!
